= Basic plugin usage and support

This page shows plugin basic usage and support.

== Apply the plugin and basic settings

A one should follow an https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.jsonschema2dataclass[official Gradle guide] to apply the plugin.

Then it's required to specify execution and their settings in the extension.

The minimal usage example looks like shown in the following table.
Examples provided follow Gradle DSL to showcase `org.jsonschema2dataclass` plugin configuration.

Plugin requires one of `java`, `java library`, `Android application` or `Android library` plugin applied to work.

Execution name `main` is an arbitrary one and any other supported name can be chosen.
Execution name must follow the regular expression `[a-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*` to generate .
Execution section might contain as many execution as project needs.

Inside any execution a developer might override any parameter as per their needs as described in xref:5.0/parameters.adoc[parameters] section.

== Demos and their statuses

Project contains various minimal `org.jsonschema2dataclass` plugin usage https://github.com/jsonschema2dataclass/js2d-gradle/tree/main/demo[demos].
These minimal applications aren't normal full-featured for a given platform, but can be used as a showcase for a plugin.

Also, there's also integration tests which are

Any contributions are welcome.
